# Awesome-Beginners
An `awesome` type curated list of resources for complete beginners to programming, or
people that are completely unaware of the world of programming.

Think of it this way. If you had a little kid, or a wife you wanted to teach how
to program, a few unexpected questions come up:

* Where do you start as a mentor?
* What's the first programming language they should learn that would not scare them off?
* How should they interface with the language? an editor? IDE?
* Should they even start with a programming language?


Pull requests happily accepted.


### Languages
*Programming languages that embrace people with little or no programming experience*

* [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) - Ruby is a soft, happy language to start with.
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Javascript is everywhere, which is why it might make sense to learn and then jump into the browser for interactions.
* [Python (Turtle)](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html) - Turtle for Python. Thanks @rantav


### Environments
*Programming experience environments that are easy to start with*

* [Processing](https://processing.org/) - THE non-programming programming environment.
* [KidsRuby](http://kidsruby.com/) - Ruby based, an IDE and various components such as Robotics etc. for full immersion.
* [Bocko](https://github.com/mfikes/bocko) - Simple Clojure imperative graphics


### Training
*Beginner or medium level training programs*
